        	Dear Jessica, <br /><br />
            	As you know I'm no word smith... and It's hard for me to express my feelings... but you can almost grasp how much I love and adore you. You hold all of my love and heart within and whenever you feel lonely you can always think of it. I feel that we are best friends, partners, and lovers. Nothing will change how I feel towards you. I can't wait for the day when we will be together again.
                <p>Your soul mate, <br /> David H. Nguyen</p>
